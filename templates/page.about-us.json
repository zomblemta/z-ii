        "description": "<p>Z-II is both our name and our method. Z is our north star: zero inventory burden and zero excess in design. We build inventory-light programs so brands can test small, sell through, and repeat without pressure. In design, we remove what doesn’t serve the garment—clean lines, precise proportions, considered fabrics—so pieces feel minimal, not plain. II reads as the Roman “two,” a symbol of two parallel promises that never collide: Design & Delivery moving as one, and two buying rhythms—In-Stock and Made-to-Order—that keep your brand agile. STUDIOS recalls our origin as a two-person studio and the discipline we kept as we grew: close collaboration, thoughtful iteration, and a boutique eye applied at scale.<br/>Z & II are our rules: zero inventory drag, zero visual noise—two quiet lines of trust steadying the path from concept to closet.</p>",

For private label, we provide brand/care labels, barcodes, compliant inner/outer packing, and full export documentation (commercial invoice, packing list, HS codes), with optional duty/tax assistance to streamline cross-border fulfillment.\nBeyond capacity, we emphasize clarity—defined milestones, transparent communication, and measurable operations (OTIF—On-Time, In-Full; First-Pass Yield)—to ensure reliable execution and repeatable outcomes.",
